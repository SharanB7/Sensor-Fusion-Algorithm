# Sensor-Fusion-Algorithm
Every sensor has some uncertainty. Also, the number of sensors to measure a quantity has increased which leads to a large amount of data. To improve the quality of the data acquired and to manage the data obtained from multiple sensors, sensor fusion is the key. Here, one of such methods, Kalman filter for linear systems is discussed. The algorithm can be applied to reduce the uncertainty of the reading obtained from a single sensor. It can also be applied to merge multiple sensor's data for both localization and mapping. Sensor fusion plays a key role in autonomous automobiles, target tracking, and robot navigation.
